1. Loading Units and Unit Groups

First off, you want to learn how to define a unit within a group.

	UNIT UnitID ClassID Leader Level(Lv,Team,A) [X,Y] B 0x00 C D [Item1,Item2,Item3,Item4] AI

A: 1 for autolevel, 0 for static level
B: 2 for item drop
C: number of REDAs (REDAs are used when units move after spawning)
D: the REDAs

Example:

	UNIT Eirika EirikaLord 0x0 Level(1,Ally,0) [1,2] 0 0 0 0 [Rapier,Vulnerary] NoAI

"Leader" is used to define a group leader when the AI is set to move in a group.
When you create a unit group, you need to define a name, and also have a blank UNIT at the end.

	SampleUnitGroup:
	UNIT Eirika EirikaLord 0x0 Level(1,Ally,0) [1,2] 0 0 0 0 [Rapier,Vulnerary] NoAI
	UNIT

There are several ways to load your unit group.

Use LOAD1 and ENUN when the group is being loaded for the first time (a unit's first appearence or an enemy unit)

	LOAD1 0x1 SampleUnitGroup
	ENUN

Use LOAD2 and ENUN when the group is not being loaded for the first time (returning party members)

	LOAD2 0x1 SampleUnitGroup
	ENUN

You can also use LoadReinforcements(), which is just a macro using LOAD1 and ENUN.

There is another macro simply called Unit() that can be used for prep screen unit placements. Your unit group there would look something like this.

	Units1:
	UNIT MyLord ...
	Unit(1,2) //the two arguments are x and y coordinates
	Unit(3,4)
	Unit(5,6)
	UNIT



1.1 Using REDAs

Usually when you spawn reinforcements you want them to come from a logical location and then move into a new position. You can achieve this using REDAs. Defining one is as follows.

	SampleREDA:
	REDA [1,2] 0 0 0 0 //the arguments in square brackets are x and y coordinates

Then you just need to assign it to your unit.

	UNIT EnemyUnit Fighter EnemyBoss Level(1,Enemy,1) [3,4] 0 0 1 SampleREDA [IronAxe] AttackInRangeAI

Note that they will move TO the location in the REDA and FROM the location defined as a UNIT.
